I'm a grad student in the [Moler Group](https://web.stanford.edu/group/moler) at Stanford University, working on scanning magnetic microscopy of quantum materials and devices using superconducting sensors.

My interests and [experiences](/cv/) include: [scientific computing](https://github.com/loganbvh/), quantum sensors and [quantum computing](https://sequencing.readthedocs.io/), and [experimental low temperature physics](/publications/).

In my free time I enjoy exploring with my dog, baking, and backpacking.
