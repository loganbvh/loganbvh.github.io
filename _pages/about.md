I'm a grad student in the [Moler Group](https://web.stanford.edu/group/moler) at Stanford University, working on scanning magnetic microscopy of quantum materials and devices using superconducting sensors.

My interests and [experiences](/cv/) include [scientific computing](https://github.com/loganbvh/), quantum sensors and [quantum computing](https://sequencing.readthedocs.io/), and [experimental low temperature physics](/publications/). In my free time, I enjoy baking and backpacking.

A major theme of my research career so far has been turning theory into efficient, intuitive code, and then into actionable insights about physical systems. I aim to identify the simplest model that contains the essential physics of a system, identify and implement a computational strategy to solve the model, and then iterate quickly, adding complexity as needed.

Examples of this pattern include:

- [SeQuencing](https://sequencing.readthedocs.io/), an open-source Python package for simulating realistic quantum control sequences, used for optimizing and benchmarking gates on bosonic qubits ([Quantum Circuits, Inc.](https://quantumcircuits.com/), 2020 [[repo](https://github.com/sequencing-dev/sequencing)]).
- Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) modeling of nonlinearities and vortex dynamics in measurements of the local magnetic response of 2D superconductors (Stanford University, ongoing).
- [SuperScreen](https://superscreen.readthedocs.io/), an open-source Python package that solves the London equation for thin film superconducting devices of arbitrary geometry (Stanford University, 2022 [[paper](../_publications/2022-07-27-compphys.md) and [repo](https://github.com/loganbvh/superscreen)]).
- Using large-scale nonlinear programming (NLP) to model the local magnetic properties of disordered Josephson junction arrays (Stanford University, 2022 [[paper](../_publications/2022-08-30-prb-nb-islands.md)]).
- GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulations to understand nonidealities in spin transfer torque-driven ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) measurements of spintronic devices (Cornell University Center for Materials Research, 2016 [[report](../files/ccmr-final-lbvh.pdf) and [slides](../files/ccmr-pres-lbvh.pdf)]).
