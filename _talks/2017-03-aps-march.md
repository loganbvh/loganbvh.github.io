[**Abstract**](http://meetings.aps.org/link/BAPS.2017.MAR.H39.2): New low-noise rf penetration depth measurements of the high-field superconducting state in the quasi-2d organic superconductor $\lambda$-$\text{(BETS)}_2\text{GaCl}_4$ are presented and compared to previous measurements of the same material [Coniglio, *et al.*, Phys. Rev. B **83**, 224507 (2011), Mielke, *et al.*, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter **13** (2001)]. The new data show very clear indication of a phase transition within the superconducting state, with the position of the $H_\mathrm{P}$ phase line significantly lower than in less clean samples, while the $H_{c2}$ phase line is unchanged. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, previously never seen below 32 T in this material, are observed at fields as low as 13 T, indicating that there is less scattering in these new samples. $H_{c2}$ is usually sensitive to spin-orbit scattering, suggesting that the unchanged upper critical field is not traditional, but rather the destruction of a FFLO state. In contrast, $H_\mathrm{P}$ should still be sensitive to changes of the spin-orbit scattering rate, consistent with the new data.
