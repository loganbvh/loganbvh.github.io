Teaching assistant for [Physics 67](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHYSICS67), Introduction to Laboratory Physics with a focus on statistical data analysis, in the 2022 Spring quarter (April - June). This course is intended to teach practical data analysis skills, and all work is performed in Jupyter notebooks (see course website [here](https://kipac.github.io/Physics67/)). I led two weekly discussion sections (~20 students each) and held weekly office hours.
