Teaching assistant for [Physics 43](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=PHYSICS43) (introductory electricity & magnetism for all non-physics STEM undergraduates at Stanford) in the 2018 Spring quarter (April - June). I led two weekly discussion sections (~20 students each), and held weekly office and tutoring hours.
