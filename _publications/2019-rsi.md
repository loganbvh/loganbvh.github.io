This paper describes the construction of a variable temperature [scanning SQUID microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_SQUID_microscopy) in a dry cryostat, enabling precision magnetometry and susceptometry at sample temperatures from 2.8 K to over 100 K. We demonstrated this capability by imaging [Abrikosov vortices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrikosov_vortex) and spatial inhomogeneity due to twin domains in optimally-doped [YBCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide) through its critical temperature at roughly 93 K (see image below).
